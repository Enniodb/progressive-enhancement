     <h2>The story</h2>
     <blockquote>
         <p> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
             That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
             They said,<q class="neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
             The farmer said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
             The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
             and in the evening everybody came back and said,<q class="neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky.
             What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
             The farmer again said,<q class="farmer"> <em>Maybe</em>.</q>
         </p>
         <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses,
             and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
             The neighbors then said,<q class="neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">bad</strong>,</q>
             and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
             The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
             and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
             Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="neighbors"> Isn’t that great!</q>
             Again, he said,<q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
         </p>
         <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
             and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it
             is <strong class="good">good</strong> or <strong class="bad">bad</strong> —
             because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
             or, you never know what will be the consequences of <strong class="good">good</strong> fortune.

        <h3>conclusion</h3>
        <p> <strong class="good">Good</strong> and
            <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> are just one perspective.
            Bananas are <strong class="good">good </strong> for monkeys,
            but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...
